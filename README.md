## Application Description

HealthHero is the smartest way for taking control of your health journey. HealthHero empowers our users with user-friendly tools and data insights all in one place.
=======
Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point -
